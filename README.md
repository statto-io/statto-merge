# statto-merge #

Merges sets of unprocessed statto data sets.

## Synopsis ##

However, you store your stats, sometimes you need to merge two sets together. You could try using this.

```js
var merge = require('statto-merge')

var a = { /* a statto data set */
var b = { /* a statto data set */
var c = { /* a statto data set */
var d = { /* a statto data set */

var result1 = merge(a, b)
var result2 = merge(a, b, c, d)
```

That's it.

## ChangeLog ##

### 0.1.0 (2015-03-29) ###

* [NEW] Initial version

## Author ##

Written by [Andrew Chilton](http://chilts.org/) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andychilton).

Written for [Tynio](https://tyn.io/) so we can use a statsd-like daemon in a much easier way. Our use-case involves a
stats callback which writes each file to Rackspace's Cloud Files, which are aggregated in a separate process elsewhere.
ie. the stats daemon is not where the hard work is, it's pretty easy.
